# Transporting-Students

Transporting-Students is an application designed to help students manage transportation for events. Students can register for events created by the admin and indicate how they will arriveâ€”whether they need a ride, are coming by themselves, or can provide rides for friends. The admin can create new events and view details of enrolled students.
